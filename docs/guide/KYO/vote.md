Kōyō Finance allows you to vote for the gauges you've deposited in. By voting for gauges, they'll claim more emissions, which will result in larger KYO prizes. Your voting power will be determined by how much veKYO you own.

First you'll have to navigate to the Vote page [koyo.finance/kyo/gauges](https://koyo.finance/kyo/gauges).

## Selecting a gauge

Once you click on a "Select a gauge +" button, a modal with guges will open.

Select a gauge by clicking on it.

## Setting vote weight

Once you've selected the gauge, you should set the vote weight to delegate to the selected page.

You set the weight on the input field that has "0 %" as a place holder and a "MAX" buttn on the right. By clicking on the "MAX" button, you delegate a 100% of your vote power to the gauge.

## Connect your wallet

If your wallet is already connected, the "Submit vote -- _gauge name_" button will be shown, so you can skip this and proceed to [Submitting vote](#submitting-vote). Otherwise you will be presented with "Connect Wallet" button, which will allow you to connect your desired wallet to Kōyō Finance.

When you choose a wallet, your wallet application will most likely open your wallet or account and ask for **confirmation to connect** to Kōyō Finance.

To use Kōyō Finance, you have to be on **Boba Network**.

## Submitting vote

To submit your vote to the gauge, you just click on the "submit vote - _gauge name_" button.

## Claiming emissions

Once the gauge, you've voted for and also deposited your LP tokens into it, starts claiming emissions, you can claim them in the table above the gauge selection button.

You can claim emissions that the gauge has claimed by pressing the claim button, which has an amount of claimable KYO displayed on it.
