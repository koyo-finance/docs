On farms page you'll be able to stake your LP tokens into gauges and earn rewards in return.

_Your rewards will depend on the amount of votes, that your gauge will recieve from the users._

First you'll have to navigate to the actual farms page [koyo.finance/kyo/farms](https://koyo.finance/kyo/farms).

## Connect your wallet

If your wallet is already connected, the "APPROVE - _pool name_" or "Deposit LP tokens" button will be shown, so you can skip this and proceed to [Approving](#approving) or [Depositing](#depositing). Otherwise you will be presented with "Connect Wallet" button, which will allow you to connect your desired wallet to Kōyō Finance.

When you choose a wallet, your wallet application will most likely open your wallet or account and ask for **confirmation to connect** to Kōyō Finance.

To use Kōyō Finance, you have to be on **Boba Network**.
